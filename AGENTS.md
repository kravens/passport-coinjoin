# Coinjoin Signer Agent Guide

This is a Foundation SDK app. Before running `foundation` commands, consult the SDK CLI guide:

- source checkout: `sdk/docs/foundation-cli.md`
- packaged SDK: `<sdk-root>/docs/guide/src/foundation-cli.md`

Use `foundation doctor` to inspect the local SDK environment. Prefer `foundation preview` for UI checks,
`foundation sim` for hosted runtime checks, and `foundation build` only when signed hardware artifacts are needed.
Do not run `foundation sideload`, `foundation logs`, or `foundation cert gen` unless the user explicitly asks for
hardware or signing work.

## Driving a real device (passport-drive MCP)

This app ships a `.mcp.json` that registers the `passport-drive` MCP server. With a Passport Prime connected
over USB, its tools let you act on the real device: capture screenshots, inject taps and swipes, and read its
logs. The device only exposes this debug channel when Developer Mode is enabled (in the device's Settings, under
Apps > Developer Mode); with it off, the connection is unavailable. On Linux, USB access also requires the
udev rules shipped at `<sdk-root>/share/99-passport.rules`; a permission error opening the device means they
are not installed (copy the file to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and reload udev). Only drive hardware when the user
asks for on-device work.
